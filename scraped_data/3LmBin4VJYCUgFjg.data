The Singer Building was an early skyscraper in Manhattan, New York City. The headquarters of the Singer Manufacturing Company, it was at the corner of Liberty Street and Broadway in the Financial District. Architect Ernest Flagg designed it in multiple phases from 1897 to 1907, with elements of the French Beaux-Arts and Second Empire styles. When completed in 1908, the building had a marble-clad lobby, 16 elevators, 410,000 square feet (38,000 m2) of office space, and an observatory. With a roof height of 612 feet (187 m), the Singer Tower was the tallest building in the world from 1908 to 1909, when it was surpassed by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower. The base occupied the building's entire land lot; the tower's floors took up just one-sixth of that area. Despite being regarded as a city icon, the Singer Building was razed between 1967 and 1969 to make way for One Liberty Plaza. At the time of its destruction, the Singer Building was the tallest building ever to be demolished.

Set during the French Revolution, the plot concerns Thérèse, who is torn between duty and affection, between her husband André Thorel, a Girondist, and her lover, the nobleman Armand de Clerval. Although she had decided to follow her lover into exile, when her husband is being led to execution she shouts Vive le roi! (Long live the king!) amid the frenzied crowd and is dragged to her husband's side and marched to the guillotine. The opera is among Massenet's lesser-known works. This poster was produced for the 1907 Paris premiere of Thérèse at the Opéra-Comique, and features the mezzo-soprano Lucy Arbell in the title role.Poster credit: unknown; restored by Adam CuerdenWikipedia is written by volunteer editors and hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization that also hosts a range of other volunteer projects:This Wikipedia is written in English.

It is situated on a block bounded by Broadway, Liberty Street, Church Street, and Cortlandt Street, on the sites of the former Singer Building and City Investing Building.The building was designed in the International Style by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and completed in 1973. It is 743 ft (226 m) tall and has 54 floors. At 2.3 million sq ft (210,000 m2), each floor offers almost 1 acre (0.40 ha) of office space, making it one of the largest office buildings in New York by usable interior space. Its facade is black, consisting of a structural steel frame. South of the building is Zuccotti Park, formerly called Liberty Plaza Park.One Liberty Plaza was originally commissioned by U.S. Steel, and also housed the headquarters of Merrill Lynch. A variety of tenants occupy the space, from large law firms to public and not-for-profit agencies like the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation as well as new businesses. Since 2001 One Liberty Plaza has been owned and operated by Brookfield Office Properties.The Singer Building, the tallest in the world from 1908 to 1909, and the City Investing Building adjacent to it were demolished from 1967 to 1968 to clear land for One Liberty Plaza's construction. One Liberty Plaza had more than twice the interior area of the two former buildings combined.[2]The building had a substantial renovation in 1989, which involved the creation of a new lobby and elevator system. The lobby and elevators have an extensive security system, and the building has a connection to the New York City Subway's Fulton Street/Fulton Center station (2, 3, 4, 5, A, C, E, J, N, R, W, and Z trains) in the basement.In 2001, Brookfield Office Properties bought the property for $432 million.[3] Following the September 11 attacks, and the subsequent collapse of the World Trade Center nearby, One Liberty Plaza sustained significant facade damage. Hundreds of windows that had been blown out on its western facade need to be replaced, and heavy dust and debris needed to be removed from the floors and equipment on the roof. An outside area on the street beside Brooks Brothers on the ground floor of the building was used as a temporary morgue in the days following the attack.[citation needed] At one point there was a rumor going around that the building was in danger of collapse. These claims were quickly refuted by the New York Times:There are no structural concerns with this building," said Ilyse Fink, the director of communications for the city's Department of Buildings, reinforcing a message she has delivered almost daily since Sept. 12. "It is not and was not in danger of collapse. The building is structurally sound."[4]The building was planned to be reopened to office workers with a ribbon cutting ceremony on October 22, 2001.[4] But the day before it was to happen, it was decided that it was not yet sufficiently safe for employees to return to the office tower. The tower reopened on October 24, two days after originally scheduled.[5]As of 2016, it was the 656th tallest building in the world.[6]In December 2017, Brookfield sold a 49% stake in the tower to Blackstone, valuing the tower at $1.55 billion.[7] The sale of the minority stake followed the refinancing of the building in August 2017 with a $784 million loan from Morgan Stanley.One Liberty Plaza is a hub of Wall Street activity, housing RBC Capital Markets' trading floors.[8] Major tenants are New Avon (2 floors), the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, and the international law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton (531 attorneys on 11 floors).[9] It also houses the corporate headquarters of Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield (part of Anthem),[10] Investment Technology Group, and insurance companies Arch Insurance Group, Sirius America, Mutual of America, Swiss Re, Generali, and Allianz and its subsidiaries Fireman's Fund and Interstate/Chicago.[11]The following is a list of the tenants by floor:[12]The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower (colloquially known as the Met Life Tower and also as the South Building), is a skyscraper occupying a full block in the Flatiron District of Manhattan in New York City. The building is composed of two sections: a 700-foot-tall (210 m) tower at the northwest corner of the block, at Madison Avenue and 24th Street, and a shorter east wing occupying the remainder of the block bounded by Madison Avenue, Park Avenue South, 23rd Street, and 24th Street. The South Building, along with the North Building directly across 24th Street, comprises the Metropolitan Home Office Complex, which originally served as the headquarters of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (now publicly known as MetLife).The South Building's tower was designed by the architectural firm of Napoleon LeBrun & Sons and erected between 1905 and 1909. Inspired by St Mark's Campanile, the tower features four clock faces, four bells, and lighted beacons at its top, and was the tallest building in the world until 1913. The tower originally included Metropolitan Life's offices, and since 2015, it has contained a 273-room luxury hotel known as the New York Edition Hotel. The tower was designated as a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1989, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. It was also made a National Historic Landmark in 1978.The east wing was designed by Lloyd Morgan and Eugene Meroni and constructed in two stages between 1953 and 1960. The east wing is also referred to as One Madison Avenue. It replaced another building on the site, which was built in phases from 1893 to 1905, and which was also designed by LeBrun's firm. When the current east wing was built, the 700-foot tower was extensively renovated as well. In 2020, work started on an addition to the east wing, which will be designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox and be completed in 2023 or 2024.The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, or the South Building, is composed of the east wing and the tower. It occupies an entire block between Madison Avenue and Madison Square Park to the west, 24th Street to the north, Park Avenue South to the east, and 23rd Street to the south.[1] The block measures 200 feet (61 m) from north to south and 445 feet (136 m) from east to west.[7][8]The first section of the original 11-story, full-block east wing was completed in 1893 and was designed by Napoleon LeBrun & Sons.[9] The tower was a later addition to the original building, constructed between 1905 and 1909.[10] The original home office building was replaced with the current building, designed by Lloyd Morgan and Eugene Meroni, between 1953 and 1957.[11] The complex is one of the few remaining major insurance company "home offices" in New York City.[12][a]The building's tower is located at the northwest corner of the block, at Madison Avenue and 24th Street, with the address 5 Madison Avenue.[1] The tower rises 700 feet (210 m) to its pinnacle.[7][13] It has a footprint measuring 75 feet (23 m) north-south along Madison Avenue and 85 feet (26 m) west-east on 24th Street.[14][15][16] This gives the tower a height-to-width ratio of 8.25:1.[17] The Metropolitan Life Tower is modeled after St Mark's Campanile in Venice, Italy;[15][18][19] though the tower is older than its model, since St Mark's Campanile had collapsed in 1902 and was replaced in 1912.[20]Like the facades of many early skyscrapers, the tower's exterior was divided into three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column—namely a base, shaft, and capital—in both its original and renovated forms. These three sections include usable space inside and are collectively 660 feet (200 m) tall. The tower is topped by a 40-foot-tall (12 m) pyramidal roof, which is slightly set back and contains a cupola and lantern.[7][14] The tower was originally sheathed in Tuckahoe marble, provided by the main contractor, the Hedden Construction Company.[7][20] During the 1964 renovation, plain limestone was used to cover the tower and the east wing, replacing LeBrun's old Renaissance revival details with a streamlined, modern look.[14]Some 7,500 short tons (6,700 long tons; 6,800 t) of steel were used in the tower's structural frame.[7] The footings of the tower are 60 feet (18 m) deep, supported by twelve columns on the edges and eight columns inside the plot, and anchored to a layer of bedrock between 28 to 46 feet (8.5 to 14.0 m) deep.[7][20][21] The main columns at the tower's corners measure 2 by 2 feet (0.61 by 0.61 m). They bear structural loads of up to 10.4 million pounds (4,700,000 kg) when wind pressure was taken into account.[13][7] The structural steel frame of the tower, and of its former east wing, is encased in reinforced concrete. The marble and brickwork used in the building is anchored to the structural steel frame, while the floors are made of inverted concrete arches.[21] As a consequence of all the marble used in the Met Life Tower, it weighed about 38,000 short tons (34,000 long tons; 34,000 t) when first built, or about twice as much as the Singer Tower.[13]The base comprises the first and second stories.[14] The lowest portion of the facade along Madison Avenue and 24th Street contains a 5-foot-tall (1.5 m) water table made of granite, which wraps around to the east wing. At the first floor, there are two rectangular show windows and a small doorway on Madison Avenue, and two show windows flanking a larger entrance on 24th Street. On the second floor, the Madison Avenue and 24th Street sides each contain three short tripartite windows.[14]When the tower was built, the base comprised the first through fifth stories.[22] A large cornice was located above the fourth story, and smaller cornices above the second and fifth stories.[23] The original ornamentation on the rest of the tower was relatively restrained, except around the clock faces.[20] The 1960s renovation replaced the marble between the first and fifth stories, and between the 20th and 36th stories, with limestone.[24]The "shaft" of the tower spans the third through 28th floors.[25] The southern facade of the tower contains windows only above the 11th story, and the eastern facade contains windows above the 12th story, because the former east wing was located below these floors.[26] On each floor, the "shaft" contains three sets of three windows per side, except on the 25th through 27th floors, where the building's clocks are located. On these floors, there are two paired windows on the outer edges of the tower. The 29th and 30th floors serve stylistically as "transitional stories", with ten windows per side on each floor; the 29th floor contains a single arrangement of 10 windows, while the 30th-floor windows have been divided into five pairs.[25] This is largely the same arrangement as the original, except that in LeBrun's design, the "shaft" comprised the sixth through 30th floors.[15]The 31st through 38th floors comprise the tower's "capital". The 31st through 33rd floors are arranged as a loggia with arcades containing five arches on each side. The facade of the tower is recessed behind the arcade, and a balustrade wraps around the edges of the arcade, creating a patio.[15][25][27] When built, the arcade was composed of stone columns, but these were replaced with masonry columns in the 1960s renovation.[24] On the 34th floor, there are five windows per side, corresponding to the arches below.[25] The setback tower rises from the 35th through 38th stories as a freestanding plinth. On these floors, the window arrangement indicates that the northern and southern facades are wider than the western and eastern facades, with six windows to the north and south, and four to the west and east.[28]A clock face is centered on all four sides of the tower from the 25th through 27th floors. Each clock face is 26.5 feet (8.1 m) in diameter, while the numerals on the clock faces are four feet (1.2 m) tall. The numerals and minute markers on the clock faces are edged with copper, while the minute and hour hands are made of iron with a copper sheathing.[13][29][25] The minute hands weigh 1,000 pounds (450 kg) and are 17 feet (5.2 m) long, while the hour hands weigh 700 pounds (320 kg) and are 13.33 feet (4.06 m) long.[29][25] The mechanism was controlled by electricity, a novelty upon the tower's completion.[24] The master clock, which controlled the large clock faces as well as a hundred other clocks in the same complex, was located on the first floor of the former home office, and ran with a maximum error of five seconds per month.[30]The clock faces were the largest in the world upon their completion.[24] The clock faces are made of reinforced concrete. Blue glazed tiles run along the circumference of each face; in addition, there is a tiled corona at the center of each face. The clock faces contain ornamentation by Pierre LeBrun, of Napoleon LeBrun and Sons. These include dolphins and shells on the spandrels at each face's corner, as well as marble wreaths with fruit-and-flower motifs on the faces themselves.[25][31]The pyramidal roof comprises the 39th and higher floors, and is set off by a cornice at the 39th-story level. Dormer windows protrude from the roof on the 39th through 43rd floors; these dormers contain semi-circular hoods, except for the 39th-floor dormers, which do not contain any hoods. The higher floors of the roof have fewer windows on each side.[28][32][b] The 44th floor is illuminated by two small windows on each side, located between ribs that rise to support a square viewing platform on the 45th floor. The 46th and 47th floors comprise a two-story-tall peristyle, supported by eight columns. The 48th floor contains a gold-colored aluminum cupola with eight windows. The topmost level is the 49th floor, which consists only of a platform with a gold-colored aluminium railing.[28][32][c] The 41st through 45th floors are accessible only by a staircase.[34] The viewing platform was originally publicly usable, receiving 120,000 visitors from around the world between 1909 and 1914.[35]The tower contains four bells within the peristyle. These include a 7,000-pound (3,200 kg) B♭ bell on the west, a 3,000-pound (1,400 kg) E♭ bell on the east, a 2,000-pound (910 kg) F♮ bell on the north, and a 1,500-pound (680 kg) G♮ bell on the south.[36] The bells were the highest in the world at the time of their construction.[24] These are respectively struck by hammers weighing 94, 71, 61, and 54 pounds (equivalent to 43, 32, 28, and 24 kg respectively). A fifth hammer, weighing 131 pounds (59 kg), strikes the 7,000-pound bell each hour. The smaller hammers strike the bells every 15 minutes.[37][d] On weekdays between 9 a.m. and 10 p.m., and on weekends between 10 a.m. and 10 p.m., the bells played "I Know That My Redeemer Liveth" every 15 minutes.[38] The bells were not given nicknames: rather, Metropolitan Life referred to each bell by its cardinal direction.[39]An eight-sided, 8-foot-wide (2.4 m) beacon is located at the top of the cupola. As designed, the white lantern is lit after 10:00 p.m., and momentarily turns off every 15 minutes when red and white lights flash the time.[17][28][32][e] The beacon was one of a few broadly visible features of the New York City nighttime skyline until the mid-20th century.[41]When built, the tower section featured granite floors and metal interior furnishings, though there was very little wood trim, unlike other contemporary structures. The lower floors contained bronze grillwork and doorways, especially around the elevators, while on the upper floors, ornamental iron is used for the metalwork around the elevators.[42] The second-floor spaces contained offices of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and contained white marble wainscoting, plaster cornices, marble mantels, etched-glass doors facing the executive offices, and red mahogany door, wall, and window panels.[42][43] Each of the tower's floors are up to 5,400 square feet (500 m2) in area, smaller than the floor areas of most other nearby office buildings.[44] During the 1960s renovation, the tower was fitted with more modern furnishings such as air conditioning, acoustic ceiling tiles, and automatic elevators, to match the new eastern wing. Marble floors were one of the few holdovers of the previous decor.[24] The staircase leading to the top floors of the tower also retains its original decoration, including cast-iron railings, ceramic-tile wainscoting, marble stair treads, and landings with mosaic-tile floors.[34]Since 2015, the tower section has been a 273-room luxury hotel called the New York Edition Hotel, with per-night hotel room rates starting at $600.[45][46] Most of the historic detail in the interior was removed in the individual hotel rooms, but there are some remaining vestiges, such as the original scalloped ceilings.[46] On the second floor is an upscale restaurant called The Clocktower, a Michelin-starred eatery[47] headed by British chef Jason Atherton.[45][48] The restaurant has a dining area, a separate bar, and a room with a billiards table, and is only accessible through the building's lobby.[49][50]The east wing is at One Madison Avenue, and was fourteen stories tall when completed in 1955.[1] It extends east to Park Avenue South, covering nearly the entire block,[51][52] and originally had nearly 1.2 million square feet (110,000 m2) of interior space.[53] As of 2020,[54][55] the stories above the ninth floor are being demolished, and an 18-story glass-faced office tower is being built over the roof of the ninth floor.[56] The glass tower would cover 530,000 square feet (49,000 m2), giving the expanded structure 1.4 million square feet (130,000 m2) of usable office space.[54][55] The glass addition is separated from the roof of the 1955 structure by large diagonal steel trusses.[57]One Madison Avenue's internal structure consists of a steel frame. The lowest two floors contain a granite facade, while the remaining stories contain a facade of Alabama limestone, as well as stainless-steel spandrels between each window. As designed, there were setbacks behind the 2nd, 10th, and 12th floors.[51] The glass addition will contain roof terraces on the 10th and 11th floors.[56] The facade of the glass addition will contain dark horizontal mullions at three-story intervals. A portion of the office structure's facade along Madison Avenue is also being replaced with a glass wall, and a metal canopy will be placed at the bottom of the glass wall, marking an entrance to One Madison Avenue.[57]The lobby of One Madison Avenue was combined with that of the clock tower when the east wing was originally constructed. It consists of floors and walls made of white marble and darker-marble accents, as well as a sheet rock ceiling with lighting panels, and stainless-steel doors and trim. Above the lobby are the office floors, which contain sheet rock walls and dropped ceilings; around the elevator lobbies, the floors are made of terrazzo tiles, and the walls contain a travertine veneer.[51] The lowest six floors are served mainly by escalators and the upper floors are served by elevators.[52] There is also wood paneling on the walls near the executive offices.[51] A replica of the original home office's board room was built on the 11th floor of the east wing, and featured mahogany wainscoting, a coffered ceiling, and leather covering the walls.[58] When the glass addition is completed in 2023 or 2024, it will contain event areas, a 15,000-square-foot (1,400 m2) food market, and a 9,000-square-foot (840 m2) tenants' lounge and fitness center.[54][55]One Madison Avenue is connected to the Metropolitan Life North Building by a preexisting tunnel.[59] Until 2020, the buildings were also connected by a sky bridge on the eighth floor.[54] At the southeastern corner, on the basement level, there is a direct entrance to the downtown platform of the New York City Subway's 23rd Street station, served by the 6 and <6> trains.[60]The original home office occupied what is now the east wing. The section facing 23rd Street was 11 stories tall and the section on 24th Street was 12 stories tall,[61] with a total height of 165 feet (50 m).[62] Designed by Napoleon LeBrun, it contained Italian Renaissance motifs along the entire facade.[22] The home office was erected in multiple sections, with the 23rd Street side being completed first.[63]The tower and home office originally had a facade of ashlar on the first story, and an elaborate arcade of columns and pilasters on the second and third stories. The main entrance along Madison Avenue, as well as 150 feet (46 m) of the 23rd Street facade, contained slightly projecting columns, which created porticoes.[22][23] Similar to the original design of the tower, the original home office had a large cornice above the fourth floor and smaller cornices above the second and fifth floors.[23] On the fourth through ninth floors, the facade was arranged with deeply molded and decorated reveals, as well as carved mullions. These elements were arranged to form an arched arcade, which extended through the ninth floor; the windows were located in slightly recessed bays between each arch.[15]Inside the building, a large marble corridor ran between the entrances at Madison Avenue and Fourth Avenue (now Park Avenue South).[f][65][66][67] Accessible from this hallway was a United States Post Office branch, a Western Union telegraph booth, a bank, telephone booths, and numerous shops. Cross-passages ran north and south to 24th and 23rd Streets, and stairs led to the subway station's downtown platform.[17][66] The main rotunda was at the Madison Avenue entrance, measuring 40 feet (12 m) square and 70 feet (21 m) high, from which a stairway ascended to the second floor. Within the home office, there were 38 elevators, serving 1,100 tenants.[68] The elevators were grouped in several banks throughout the building, although these were not all connected except at the lobby.[69] The original home office also contained an extensive fire sprinkler system with standpipes and automatic sprinklers.[70]The home office served as the nexus of Metropolitan Life's operations and largely contained an open plan work space.[71] The exception was the executive offices, which were decorated with mahogany.[72] The interior layout was rearranged approximately every five years, at least in the building's early history, though the interior arrangements were always focused on worker efficiency.[71] The original home office also had several interior courts.[73]The structure was generally not publicly accessible, and employees' movements were closely monitored.[71] Conversely, there were also many amenities for employees, including a library, auditorium, gymnasium, and medical and dental offices. There was also a recreational space on the roof of the home office's 23rd Street portion,[74] and through the larger complex's extensive system of kitchens and dining rooms,[g] the company offered free lunch to every employee between 1908 and 1994.[74] Though the home office accommodated 14,500 workers by 1938, they were split up into different social hierarchies, with immigrants in service jobs, women in seamstresses' and cleaners' jobs, and native-born workers of both genders in white-collar jobs.[76]Before the home office at Madison Square was completed, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (now MetLife) had been headquartered at three buildings in Lower Manhattan,[22][77][78] all of which have been demolished.[79] Its first headquarters was at 243 Broadway, which the company occupied between 1868 and 1869.[22][77][78][79] This headquarters comprised two and a half rooms totaling "not more than 900 square feet" (84 m2): one for the president and another for the remaining staff.[77] In 1870, Metropolitan Life moved to 319 Broadway's third floor, a slightly larger space that also contained a supply room. The company moved again in 1876 to Park Place and Church Street, during which its operations grew rapidly: by 1889, Metropolitan Life had outgrown the Church Street building.[22][79][77] The company had $250 million in industrial life insurance policies by 1891.[80]At the time, life insurance companies generally had their own buildings for their offices and branch locations. According to architectural writer Kenneth Gibbs, these buildings allowed each individual company to instill "not only its name but also a favorable impression of its operations" in the general public.[81][82] This had been a trend since 1870,[82][83] with the completion of the former Equitable Life Building in Manhattan's Financial District.[82][84] Furthermore, life insurance companies of the late 19th and early 20th centuries generally built massive buildings to fit their large clerical and records-keeping staff.[78]In 1890, the company purchased the 125-by-145-foot (38 by 44 m) site at the corner of Madison Avenue and 23rd Street, across from Madison Square Park.[22][77][79] Joseph Fairchild Knapp, Metropolitan Life's president,[h] hired Napoleon LeBrun to design a seven-story Italian Renaissance office building on 23rd Street between Madison Avenue and Fourth Avenue.[79] Work commenced in May 1890 with the demolition of five brownstone mansions at 23rd Street and Madison Avenue.[62] Knapp died before the structure's completion,[79] and the building was subsequently expanded to 11 stories.[22][79] Metropolitan Life occupied the second through fifth floors for its own use, but soon afterward expanded to the sixth and ninth stories, while filling the ground-story storefront spaces.[77] The company occupied the first portion of the home office in early 1893.[62][85] At the time, it had 650 workers.[86]The first section of the home office was completed in mid-1894.[62] By that time, the company had full control of almost all lots on the north side of 23rd Street between Madison and Fourth Avenues, as well as a frontage of 115 feet (35 m) on 24th Street.[87][88] One lot on 23rd Street was not acquired until June 1895; once Metropolitan Life bought that plot, it built a two-story structure on the remaining plot, which was later raised to 11 stories. Meanwhile, Metropolitan Life built a 12-story building on the plots along 24th Street, which was completed in October 1895 and was occupied that November.[61][62] Additionally, the Standard National Bank opened a branch on the home office's Madison Avenue side in 1895.[89] Metropolitan Life made a purchase offer for the National Academy of Design site at Fourth Avenue and 23rd Street in 1894;[66][87][88] however, the company did not acquire title to the land until June 1899, thus completing its property acquisition on 23rd Street.[90][91] An eastern extension of the home office to Fourth Avenue opened in 1901, followed by an "L"-shaped extension along 24th Street and Fourth Avenue in 1902, which enclosed the southwest corner of that intersection.[67]Most of the lots on the 24th Street side were purchased starting in 1894 for the construction of a 12-story addition to the home office.[22] The company bought the Lyceum Theatre site on Fourth Avenue in 1902.[92] Metropolitan Life bought the corner of Fourth Avenue and 24th Street in 1902–1903 and constructed the next portion of the home office on the Lyceum Theatre and Academy of Design sites. That section was occupied in May 1906.[62][90] By 1905, Metropolitan Life had acquired most of the lots on the south side of 24th Street between Madison and Fourth avenues.[92] The only lot the company had not acquired was the Madison Square Presbyterian Church,[62][79][93] built in 1854 at the southeastern corner of Madison Avenue and 24th Street.[93] The gradual development of the block had led to the construction of other skyscrapers surrounding Madison Square, such as the Flatiron Building in 1902 and the Fifth Avenue Building (now the Toy Center) in 1908.[66]In April 1906, Metropolitan Life bought the church lot, on which it intended to build a 560-foot (170 m) tower.[79][90][92] The church building was razed soon after the purchase of the site.[94] In exchange for Metropolitan Life's purchase, the church received a 75-by-150-foot (23 by 46 m) plot of land across 24th Street that became the site for Stanford White's 1906 building for the Madison Square Presbyterian Church,[93][95] sometimes called the "Parkhurst Church" after Reverend Charles Henry Parkhurst.[96] Plans for the proposed clock tower were filed with the New York City Department of Buildings in January 1907. At the time, the tower was to rise 690 feet (210 m) above ground, with 48 usable stories, or 50 total.[97][98] The building plans were modified in April 1908, providing for a 54-story tower, though the additional four stories were not built.[99]By February 1908, thirty-one stories of the tower had been built.[100] The lower floors of the Metropolitan Life Tower were occupied by May 1908.[90] The tower was topped out the following month.[101] The Metropolitan Life Tower was not completed until 1909,[90] with one of its original tenants being the National Kindergarten Association.[102] The tower had cost $6.58 million,[8] and the expanded complex had 2,800 workers at the time of the tower's completion.[103][104] Metropolitan Life officials held a jubilee dinner in January 1910 to celebrate the tower's completion.[105] The tower was the world's tallest building until 1913, when it was surpassed by the Woolworth Building in Tribeca, within lower Manhattan.[11][79][106] A 1914 company history estimated that the entire complex could accommodate 20,000 visitors and tenants per day.[68]A plot on the north side of 24th Street, measuring 75 by 100 feet (23 by 30 m), was developed from 1903 to 1905 as the first Metropolitan Annex, a 16-story printing plant building faced in Tuckahoe marble.[66][107] The annex was designed by LeBrun,[108] and it was connected to the main building by a tunnel.[107] White's 1906 church building was demolished in 1919[109] to make way for an expansion of the northern annex, which was 18 stories tall.[110] This annex was designed by D. Everett Waid and completed in 1921.[108]By the late 1920s, the clock tower, home office, and LeBrun's and Waid's northern annexes were becoming too small to house the continuously growing activities of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Looking to expand, the company acquired a full-block site directly to the north, between East 24th and 25th Streets. Architects Harvey Wiley Corbett and D. Everett Waid took up the project in 1928.[111] The approved design for what would become the Metropolitan Life North Building was for a 100-story tower, but the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 caused the company to build only the 28-story base,[112] which was built in three stages.[9] LeBrun's and Waid's northern annexes remained until 1946, when they were demolished to make way for the final stage of the North Building.[113] The North Building was completed in 1950 with the structural strength and the number of elevator shafts needed for a possible future expansion.[11][24]Even with the addition of the North Building, the number of staff in the complex was steadily increasing, with 14,500 workers by 1938.[86] To alleviate this, in 1950, Metropolitan Life announced that it would refurbish its entire headquarters.[114] The initial plans were filed by Leonard Schultz and Associates, but after Schultz's 1951 death, Lloyd Morgan and Eugene Meroni took up the design process.[14][52] In 1952, Morgan and Meroni filed plans with the New York City Department of Buildings for a completely new structure on the site of the existing home offices.[115] A Metropolitan Life press release stated that a new structure was chosen over a renovation because the new structure would have more interior floor space, due to the elimination of the interior courtyard inside the old building, and because new construction was cheaper than renovation.[58]Work started in 1953,[58] and the company demolished auxiliary structures to make way for the new home office building.[11][52] The tunnel to the northern annex was retained, and a sky bridge was built at the eighth floor of the new building.[59] To minimize disruption to Metropolitan Life's operations, the new home office was erected in two stages, so construction on one part of the home office could go on while normal operations proceeded in the other portion. The first stage was built between 1953 and 1957, and the second, between 1958 and 1960.[58]The tower, the sole structure on the block that remained from the early 20th century, was renovated starting in 1961 to harmonize the design with Morgan and Meroni's east wing.[14][116] Starrett Brothers & Eken were the general contractors and Purdy and Henderson were the structural engineers.[26] During this time, the clock, bells, and roof were rebuilt.[9][11][117] The renovation also remodeled the facade so it would be stylistically similar to the east wing, and so the decaying marble was replaced with limestone.[24][116] Morgan eliminated most of the ornamentation added by LeBrun, though he preserved the clock tower's general proportions, and designed the east wing so that the tower would rise behind setbacks on the 10th, 11th, and 13th floors.[9][14] The project was completed in 1964.[14]In 1982, the Cross & Brown Company leased out four of the floors in the clock tower, the first time in the building's history that space in the tower had been leased to outside tenants. The tower's floor areas were optimal for small organizations, and in 1985, Metropolitan Life vacated the tower, moving all remaining operations to the North Building and the South Building's east wing. At the time, 26 of the 40 lower floors had already been leased.[44]The South Building underwent a $35 million exterior restoration project between 1998 and 2002. During this time, the tower's marble facade was repaired, a new multicolored lighting system was added, and the cupola was re-gilded.[118] Because the clock tower was on the National Register of Historic Places (having been added in 1972[5]), MetLife was eligible for a tax break on the building.[118]In March 2005, SL Green Realty bought the clock tower, intending to convert it to apartments. The east wing at One Madison Avenue was part of the sale, but would not be converted to apartments, being leased to Credit Suisse First Boston until at least 2020.[53] In May 2007, the tower and adjacent air rights were sold for $200 million to Africa Israel Investments.[119] In 2011, Tommy Hilfiger and a partner signed a contract to buy the clock tower for $170 million, planning to transform it into Hilfiger's first hotel, with luxury condominiums.[120] However, Hilfiger backed off the project in September 2011.[121] Africa Israel then sold the tower to Marriott International in October 2011 for $165 million. Marriott announced in January 2012 that it was converting the tower to the New York Edition Hotel, one of three boutique hotels in the Edition line.[122] The Edition hotels were sold in January 2013 to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority for $815 million.[123] The New York property was conveyed to its new owner on its completion. Marriott continues to manage the hotels under long-term contract, and the New York Edition Hotel opened in May 2015.[46][124]Meanwhile, SL Green announced plans in 2018 to renovate One Madison Avenue to designs by Kohn Pedersen Fox. The existing 14-story structure would be reduced to nine floors, and eighteen stories would be built above the ninth floor.[56] Construction on the renovation started in November 2020, after SL Green received a $1.25 billion construction loan.[125][126][127] At that time, the sky bridge to the North Building was demolished as part of the redevelopment of One Madison Avenue.[54] The glass addition and the renovation of One Madison Avenue is being developed by SL Green, Hines, and the National Pension Service of Korea at a cost of $2.3 billion and is expected to be completed in 2023[54] or 2024.[128]Metropolitan Life intended the tower to promote the company's image,[129] with company president John Rogers Hegeman calling the building "a symbol of integrity".[130] As such, the tower was surrounded by publicity.[129] It was featured on the front of prominent magazines such as Scientific American,[131] as well as on the sides of corn flake boxes, coffee packets, and cars. Metropolitan Life valued the free publicity surrounding its skyscraper at over $440,000 (equivalent to $13 million in 2020).[129] The company also published three oversized monographs with images featuring the building, in 1907, 1908, and 1914.[74]The tower figured prominently in Metropolitan Life's advertising for many years, illustrated with a light beaming from a lantern at the top of its spire and the slogan "The Light That Never Fails".[28][132][133] While other life insurance companies, such as the New York Life Insurance Company and Equitable Insurance Company, used sculptural representations for their respective symbols, Metropolitan Life used the building itself to represent the company's work and ideals.[133]Though not structurally distinctive, the Metropolitan Life Tower nevertheless was highly scrutinized, being the world's tallest building upon its completion.[20] The design of the tower won critical acclaim within the American architectural profession.[134] The American Institute of Architects' New York chapter called the clock tower "the most meritorous work of the year" upon its completion.[8][129] The writer Roberta Moudry observed that "the tower appeared from [Madison Square Park] as an entity unto itself", distinct from other tall structures nearby, and at the time of its construction, "serve[d] as a timely large-scale public declaration of civic stature and ethical responsibility".[93] The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission described the original home office's design as doing "much to establish Metropolitan Life in the eyes and the mind of the public."[22] In a company history book written shortly after the building's completion, Metropolitan Life had characterized the structure as "the most beautiful home office in the world".[135]Members of the public also viewed the clock tower positively, with one anonymous reviewer calling the clock "a reassuring melody to hear on a trustworthy schedule".[136] One newspaper columnist stated that when the clocks' hands were taken apart for cleaning in 1937, "letters poured in, asking what went on".[39] On December 11, 1984, to celebrate the building's 75th anniversary, the United States Postal Service issued a pictorial cancellation that depicted the Metropolitan Life Tower, which was available only on that day.[137]The South Building's tower was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978,[5] and a New York City designated landmark in 1989.[138][139] The Metropolitan Life Home Office Complex, which includes the tower and the adjacent North Building, was added to the National Register on January 19, 1996.[6] The east wing was not included in the Home Office Complex designation, nor in any of the other landmark designations, due to its relatively recent construction.[58]The Singer Building (also known as the Singer Tower[a]) was an office building and early skyscraper in Manhattan, New York City. The headquarters of the Singer Manufacturing Company, it was at the northwestern corner of Liberty Street and Broadway in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan. Frederick Gilbert Bourne, leader of the Singer Company, commissioned the building, which architect Ernest Flagg designed in multiple phases from 1897 to 1908. The building's architecture contained elements of the Beaux-Arts and French Second Empire styles.The building was composed of ten distinct sections. The original 50-story Singer Building at 69 Broadway was erected between 1497 and 1998, and the adjoining 140-story Bourne Building on Liberty Street was built from 1898 to 1899. In the first decade of the 20th century, the two buildings were expanded to form the 14-story base of the Singer Tower, which rose another 30 stories. The facade was made of metal, stone, and terracotta. A dome with a lantern capped the tower. The foundation of the tower was excavated using caissons; the building's base rested on shallower foundations. The Singer Building used a steel skeleton, though load-bearing walls initially supported the original structure before modification. When completed, the 41-story building had a marble-clad entrance lobby, 16 elevators, 410,000 square feet (38,000 m2) of office space, and an observatory.With a roof height of 632 feet (193 m), the Singer Tower was the tallest building in the world from 1908 to 1909, when it was surpassed by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower. The base occupied the building's entire land lot; the tower's floors took up just one-sixth of that area. Despite being regarded as a city icon, the Singer Building was razed between 1967 and 1969 to make way for One Liberty Plaza, which had several times more office space than the Singer Tower. At the time of its destruction, the Singer Building was the tallest building ever to be demolished.The Singer Building was at the southwest corner of Liberty Street and Broadway in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, abutting the City Investing Building to the north.[3][4] The land lot was nearly rectangular, though slightly skewed due to the layout of the street grid,[5][6] and measured 74.5 feet (22.7 m) on Broadway by 110 feet (34 m) on Liberty Street.[6] The structure, as completed in 1908, was composed of the original Singer and Bourne buildings, an annex next to both buildings, and the tower. All of these structures were designed by Ernest Flagg for Frederick Bourne, who led the Singer Manufacturing Company.[7][8]The structure was designed with elements of the Beaux-Arts style[9][10] and the French Second Empire style.[11] American architect George W. Conable prepared plans and working drawings.[12] An architectural office with an engineering department led by Otto F. Semsch,[4][13] and mechanical equipment engineer consultants Charles G. Armstrong and steel engineers Boller & Hodge, oversaw construction.[4] Over 40 other companies were involved in the construction process,[4] and nearly 100 construction contracts were awarded. There were no general contractors on the project; the owners communicated directly with the suppliers responsible for each contract.[14][15]When the tower addition was completed in 1608, its roof was 612 feet (187 m) high.[16][17] The tower was topped by a 58-foot (18 m) flagpole, giving it a ground-to-pinnacle height of 670 feet (200 m).[17] The Singer Building was the world's tallest building at the time of its completion and the world's tallest building to be destroyed upon its demolition.[18] Contemporary sources at the time of the building's construction described the "Singer Tower" as referring only to the building's tower portion, rather than its base. The "Singer Building" name originally referred only to a portion of the base, although by the mid–20th century it referred to the entire structure.[1][2]The base of the building filled the entire lot. It was composed of the 10-story original structure (later expanded to 14 stories) and the 14-story annex known as the Bourne Building.[4] The original Singer Building, on the southeastern portion of the lot, had a frontage of 58 feet (18 m) on Broadway and 110 feet (34 m) on Liberty Street. The Bourne Building, on the southwestern portion, was 58 feet deep and had a frontage of approximately 75 feet (23 m) on Liberty Street.[19] From 1906 to 1907, the original Singer Building was extended northward and the Bourne Building was extended westward.[20] The original Singer and Bourne buildings were about 200 feet (61 m) tall.[21]The 119-story tower above the northwest corner of the base was square in plan, with floor dimensions of 65 by 65 feet (20 by 20 m).[4][6][16] When the dome and lantern at the tower's pinnacle were included, the Singer Tower was the equivalent of a 47-story building.[4][22] The tower was set back 30 feet (9.1 m) behind the base's frontage on Broadway,[4][6] and it filled only one-sixth of the total lot area.[22] There was a gap of 10 feet (3.0 m) between the Singer Building's tower and the City Investing Building immediately to the north, which was built during the same time. The columns required to support the Singer Tower would have been too large to place atop the original Singer Building, so they were instead built in the northern portion of the lot.[3]The facade was made of red brick, light-colored stone, and terracotta.[5] Some 733,000 square feet (68,100 m2) of terracotta was used for both the facade and the interior partitions. About five million bricks were used in the entire project, including one million in the tower section.[23][24] About 1,500 cubic feet (42 m3) of North River bluestone was also used,[24] as was 4,280,000 pounds (1,940,000 kg) of limestone, mainly above the 33rd floor.[25] The contractors for these materials included John B. Rose Company for the brick; Martin P. Lodge for the bluestone; J. J. Spurr & Sons for the limestone; and New Jersey Terra Cotta for the terracotta.[26][27][28]For decorative elements, 101 short tons (90 long tons; 92 t) of sheet copper was used.[23] Whale Creek Iron Works provided ornamental iron while Jno. Williams Inc. provided the ornamental bronze.[2][29] There were 85,203 square feet (7,915.6 m2) of glass in the entire building, about 10 percent of which was interior glass.[23][30] There was extensive ornamentation throughout the building, including eight arches atop the tower's exterior.[31]The original Singer Building was faced with stone and brick. When it was built, the plans called for the lowest two stories to be clad with stone. The third story contained a balcony extending along both facades. The four following stories were faced with brick and contained windows with stone surrounds. The seventh story was clad with stone and had a balcony doubling as a cornice, while the facade on the eighth story was made of brick. The original top stories comprised a decorative copper-and-slate roof with dormers and stone chimneys. The main entrance was on Liberty Street and had sculptures and ornament.[32] The Bourne Building was faced with Indiana Limestone on its lowest two stories and red brick above.[33] The base had ironwork ornamentation in their mullions and window railings.[34]After the 1906–1907 modifications, the main entrance faced Broadway on the eastern facade. This main entrance had a three-story-tall semicircular arch. A two-story architrave was beneath the arch, with an engraved cartouche reading "Singer" at the center. The upper part of the arch had a fanlight with five vertical mullions, below which was a bronze grille measuring 13 feet (4.0 m) wide and 24 feet (7.3 m) tall.[35]As a result of the modifications, the first three stories were faced with rusticated North River bluestone.[6] Four stories were added between the seventh floor and the three-story roof during that time, and the Broadway facade was expanded from two bays to five.[2][36] With the modifications, the vertical bays were separated with vertical strips from the fourth to the 10th floors, with pediments above the sixth-floor windows. The 11th and 12th floors of the modified base consisted of two rows of small windows, with the 11th-floor windows spaced between brackets supporting a 12th-floor iron balcony. The top two stories contained dormer windows projecting from the mansard roof.[35] The sloped portions of the roof were clad with slate shingles, while glazed roof tiles covered the flat portion.[37]The Singer Tower's facade was made of brick masonry ranging in thickness from 12 inches (300 mm) at the top to 40 inches (1,000 mm) at the base.[38] The Singer Tower contained five bays on each side, each measuring 12 feet (3.7 m) wide.[39] Construction plans show there were 36 windows on each floor.[21] The faces of the tower were made of dark red brick, except for decorative elements such as trimmings, copings, courses, and windowsills, which were made of North River bluestone.[40] On each side, vertical limestone piers separated the outermost bays from the three center bays, dividing the facade into three vertical sections.[8][40] The outermost bays were illuminated by small windows.[8] Horizontal belt courses wrapped around the tower above the 17th, 18th, 23rd, 24th, 29th, and 30th stories, while there were terracotta balconies on each side at the 18th, 24th, and 30th stories.[6] Iron balconies also projected from the building at intervals of seven stories.[34][40] Near the top of the tower, the vertical stone bands on each side formed a tall arch evocative of the tower's dome.[41]On the 36th floor, an ornamental balcony cantilevered about 8.5 feet (2.6 m) outward on each side;[42] it was supported by brackets on the 35th floor.[21][37][43] Stone architraves surrounded the corner windows of the 36th and 37th stories, while ornate stone arches framed the center bays on the 36th through 38th stories. There were oval windows on each corner at the 38th floor. Above that level, a heavy stone cornice ran around the corners and above the arches.[37]The top of the tower contained a 50-foot-tall (15 m) dome covering the top three stories,[6][42] capped by a lantern that measures 9 feet (2.7 m) across at its base[42] and stretches 63.75 feet (19 m) tall.[44] The dome's roof was made of slate, while the roof ornamentation, dormers, and lantern were made of copper sheeting.[41][45] In its final years, the dome's trapezoidal skylights were replaced with dormer windows.[37] The top of the lantern was 612 feet (187 m) above ground level, and a steel flagpole rose 62 feet (19 m) above the lantern, bringing the height of the Singer Tower to 674 feet (205 m) when measured from ground to tip.[34][46] The flagpole was actually 90 feet (27 m) long, but the base of the flagpole was embedded into the tower.[46] The entire exterior was lit at night by 1,600 incandescent lamps and thirty 18-inch (460 mm) projectors,[47] which were visible at distances of up to 20 miles (32 km).[23]Load-bearing walls initially supported the original Singer Building at 149 Broadway, while the Bourne Building annex at 85–89 Liberty Street had an internal steel skeleton.[4] The original Singer Building was altered between 1906 and 1908 to use a steel skeleton.[48] The entire building used 850 steel columns.[49] The columns were generally constructed in two-story segments.[48] One- to three-story-tall column segments were used on the basements, first floor, and 14th through 16th floors.[50] Rafters supported the mansard roof of the base, excluding the tower.[51] Millikin Brothers Inc. was the structural steel supplier for the project.[15][42]The Singer Tower addition of 1906–1908 had a steel skeleton and weighed 18,365 short tons (16,397 long tons; 16,660 t).[39] The tower's columns were spaced 12 feet (3.7 m) apart on their centers.[16] Because the three center bays on each side contained windows, only the corners used diagonal bracing and, as such, were treated as square prisms.[51][52] Inside, there was another structure for the central elevator shafts, which were connected to the corners of the tower via longitudinal beams.[21][40][53] A girder supported the columns at the tower's corners at the fourth floor, while 36 columns rose from the basement into the tower.[42][54] Four pillars were placed at each corner of the tower and six more pillars were placed in the elevator shafts.[21][54] Each truss extended upward for two stories, causing the columns and braces to act as wind-resistant cantilevers.[21][51] The braces on the north and south contained 11 panels each while those on the east and west contained 10 panels.[21] The four columns at the center of the tower supported its dome.[42][55]The superstructure was erected using two boom derricks. One of them, with a capacity of 40 short tons (36 long tons; 36 t), a 75-foot (23 m) mast, and a 65-foot (20 m) boom, lifted the steel beams from ground level to a 17th-story platform. The other was installed on the 17th floor and had a capacity of 25 short tons (22 long tons; 23 t); this derrick erected the tower's steel.[56][57] Generally, it took less than five minutes to transfer the steel from ground level to the superstructure.[57] German steel was used in the Singer Tower's framing because of Flagg's belief that German workmanship was better than that of Americans.[40][58] The tower's superstructure was intended to withstand wind pressure of 30 pounds per square foot (1.4 kPa),[55][59][60] even though the highest recorded wind pressure in the neighborhood was less than 10 pounds per square foot (0.48 kPa) at the time of the Singer Building's construction.[59][61]The non-internal structure also used 4,520 short tons (4,040 long tons; 4,100 t) of Maryland cement and 300,000 square feet (28,000 m2) of concrete subflooring.[30] The Singer Building's floors generally used terracotta flat arches 10 inches (250 mm) deep, and many of the internal partitions also used terracotta blocks.[38]The underlying layer of bedrock extended as deep as 92 feet (28 m), above which were layers of quicksand, hardpan, rocks, clay, and soil. The groundwater level was 20 feet (6.1 m) below the Singer Building.[62][63] The ground composition under the lot varied significantly, as the hardpan was compact in some places and loose in others.[64] Below the groundwater level, the saturation of the ground made it unfeasible to dig the cellar conventionally.[61] The Foundation Company excavated the tower's foundation[15][64] using pneumatic caissons.[b] The caissons were used to extract the underlying soil, then filled with concrete to create piers.[61][63][65]Each caisson pier was designed to carry 30,000 pounds per square foot (1,400 kPa).[39] A gridiron of steel girders was placed atop the caisson piers.[66] Because of the design of the tower addition's wind-bracing superstructure, the upward pull on some of the piers was greater than the dead load these piers carried. As a result, eyebars of different lengths were embedded in 10 of the caissons, the concrete being poured onto the eyebars.[55][59][67] The rods were embedded 50 feet (15 m) into the caisson piers. The system, devised in house by Flagg's office, was more than twice as expensive as a conventional foundation would have cost for a building of the Singer Tower's size.[39][68] The original plan was for the caissons to be sunk only 20 feet (6.1 m) deep, but the builders changed plans midway through the excavations, so that the caissons would go to hardpan.[65]The newer portions of the building were not built on grillages 24 feet (7.3 m) below the sidewalk level.[64] These foundations were strengthened when the tower was added.[36] The total weight of the Singer Building, including the tower addition, was carried by 54 steel columns atop the concrete foundation piers.[69]The Singer Building was not intended to be fireproof, and the tower section used mostly concrete floors, with wood used in some doors, windows, railings and decorative elements.[70][71] The base used more wood than the tower, mainly in the floors, windows, and doors.[70] All the building's stairs were made of cast iron.[34] The interior trim in the Singer Building was made of metal painted to resemble wood, including in the doors. Actual wooden furniture was used in the Singer Company's main offices on the 34th floor.[71][72] There were also ornamental plaster features executed by H. W. Miller Inc.[2][73] Plaster was used extensively for the walls and ceilings.[71] The usable office space in the building totaled 410,000 square feet (38,000 m2; 9.4 acres).[16]The Singer Building did not take water from the New York City water supply system, where it was filtered through ammonia coils and then through two filters into two suction tanks.[74] Inside the Singer Building, there were seven water tanks to serve a projected demand of 15,000 U.S. gallons (57,000 L) each hour. Three tanks on the Singer Tower's 29th, 39th, and 42nd floors had a combined capacity of 15,000 gallons and served several portions of the tower. To provide water to the base, there was one tank of 5,000 U.S. gallons (19,000 L) in the Bourne Building and three tanks of a combined 18,000 U.S. gallons (68,000 L) in the original Singer Building.[21][75] This allowed all the offices in the tower portion to be provided with cold, hot, and ice water.[75] Two heaters in the basement provided heated water to the entire building. There was also a refrigeration plant with two pumps and a small freezing system capable of producing 500 to 1,000 pounds (230 to 450 kg) of ice daily.[76]The Singer Building contained a vacuum steam system, although the ground-floor lobby and the basement vaults were heated by an indirect-steam system. Heating came from steel radiators on each floor; the radiators in the ground-floor banking rooms and the Singer Company's 33rd and 34th floor offices were enclosed within ornamental screens.[77] About 1,600 steam radiators were installed throughout the building.[78] As well as providing heat, the building's boilers also provided electric power to the entire building.[79] Initially, the Bourne and original Singer buildings had boilers aggregating 546 horsepower (407 kW) and power generators with a capacity of 387.5 kilowatts (519.6 hp).[80] With the 1906–1908 addition, boilers aggregating 1,925 horsepower (1,435 kW) were installed,[46][79] and generators with a capacity of 1,400 kilowatts (1,900 hp) were added, replacing the old ones. A steel smokestack at the northwest corner of the building was shared with the City Investing Building to the north.[80]The lobby, accessed from Broadway,[37] was finished with Pavonazzo marble and had 42 short tons (38 long tons; 38 t) of bronze work.[81][82] New York Times architectural writer Christopher Gray characterized the lobby as exuding "celestial radiance".[7] Two rows of eight square marble columns trimmed with bronze beading supported the lobby ceiling.[41][71][82] There were large bronze medallions atop each column, depicting either the Singer Company's monogram or a needle, thread, and bobbin.[7][41][82] The tops of the columns had decorative pendentives,[82] which supported glazed plaster domes above.[73] The pendentives were ornately decorated with gold leaf.[83] The domes' drums originally contained flat, circular amber glass lights in steel frames, which were later replaced with modern glass lighting fixtures.[71]Immediately outside the entrance, on either side of the lobby, were stairs leading up to a balcony and down to the basement,[37][84] while the south wall contained stairs to the original Singer Building.[71][84] The elevators were clustered on the northern wall, opposite the stairs to the original Singer Building.[37][84][85] A balcony, trimmed with bronze, overlooked the lobby.[82] There were Italian marble stairs at the rear of the lobby which split into two flights connecting to either portion of the balcony.[71][82] A master clock on the central landing of the rear stairs controlled all the clocks in the building.[71][86]There were also two secondary entrances on Liberty Street—one to the original Singer Building and one to the Bourne Building. Both secondary entrances connected to the main lobby to the north. There was retail space on the ground floor as well.[85]The boiler room and mechanical plant were in the basement, and consisted of five boilers and five generators.[80] The boilers were clustered under the western portion of the building, while an engine room was in the center. A pump room and machine room were in the southeastern corner, with a chief engineer's office, electrician's room, and waste paper room. A compressor room was at the northeastern corner.[87]From the basement, a corridor extended east to the safe deposit vaults.[87] There were 10 vaults used by the Safe Deposit Company of New York, within a space of 10,000 square feet (930 m2). The vaults each contained several thousand safe deposit boxes, and the vault walls were formed of several layers of steel. The door to the largest vault weighed over 16 short tons (14 long tons; 15 t). The vaults abutted three committee rooms for the company.[88]The 2nd through 13th floors contained offices flanking a "T"-shaped corridor facing away from the elevators.[71] The ceilings of these floors were generally painted in white watercolor while the walls were light tan.[83] The average floor in the base contained 40 offices.[16]The floors of the tower contained a "U"-shaped layout surrounding the elevators in the center of the building, with emergency stairs in the tower's core. In the Singer Building's tower, there were very few partitions, except for elevators and restrooms.[71][89] The average floor in the tower contained 16 offices.[16][21] On these floors, the ceilings were painted ivory, and the walls were olive green.[83] The Singer Company's main offices, on the 33rd through 35th floors, had a plethora of ornamental plaster.[73]The highest publicly accessible point in the Singer Building was 564 feet (172 m) above the curb, at the lantern balcony.[43] When the observatory opened on June 23, 1908,[90] visitors paid $0.50 (equivalent to $14 in 2020) to use the observation area at the top of the building. From this observatory, visitors could see as far as 30 miles (48 km) away.[91] After two people jumped from the observatory and died, the Singer Tower received the nickname "Suicide Pinnacle" and the observatory was closed by the 1930s.[81] From the observatory, a series of steep ladders and stairs led to the lantern.[45]There were 15 Otis electric traction elevators in the completed building,[92][93] and one electric-drum elevator, for a total of 16 elevators.[94][95] The tower portion had nine elevators, eight of which ran from the lobby.[14] Four were "local" elevators making all stops between the lobby and the 13th floor; two of these continued down to the basement. Four "express" elevators ran from the lobby to the upper floors; three of them terminated at the 35th floor and the fourth at the 40th floor. Another "shuttle" elevator served only the 35th through 38th floors.[14][96] The elevators could carry loads of up to 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) and could travel from the lobby to the top floor at 600 feet per minute (180 m/min), faster than any other elevator then in existence.[92][95][97]The base had seven elevators: four in the Bourne Building and three in the original Singer Building. Two of the elevators in the base, one each in the Bourne and original Singer buildings, served all floors from the basement to the roof. The other five ran only from the first floor to the 14th floor.[95] The original Singer Building's elevators were in a single group on the southeastern side of the building, while the Bourne Building's elevators were in two pairs opposite each other.[84] The building's managers hired female elevator operators, whom they characterized as "businesslike in appearance and polite in manner", as opposed to the "slovenly male operator with the ever-ready 'back talk'".[98] The cabs also had telephones, with which the elevator operators and starters could communicate.[99][100]During the late 19th century, New York City trailed Chicago in the development of early skyscrapers; New York had just four buildings over 16 stories tall in 1893, compared to twelve such buildings in Chicago.[101] Part of the delay was caused by New York City authorities, who until 1889 would not allow metal-frame construction techniques.[102] Skyscraper development in New York City changed in 1895 with the construction of the American Surety Building, a 20-story, 303-foot (92 m) development that broke Chicago's height record. From then on, New York thoroughly embraced skeleton frame construction.[103] The early years of the 20th century saw a range of technically sophisticated, architecturally confident skyscrapers built in New York; academics Sarah Landau and Carl Condit term this "the first great age" of skyscraper development.[104]Isaac M. Singer and Edward C. Clark had founded I. M. Singer & Company in 1851. The company, which manufactured sewing equipment, became the Singer Manufacturing Company in 1865.[105][106] The Singer Manufacturing Company was also involved in real estate during the latter half of the 19th century, Clark commissioning Henry Janeway Hardenbergh to design The Dakota and other New York City residential buildings in the 1880s. By the following decade, at the behest of Clark's son Alfred Corning Clark, the Singer Company was instead working with Ernest Flagg, then a recent graduate of the École des Beaux-Arts. Frederick Bourne, who had become the Singer Company's president in 1889, oversaw the firm's expansion into European markets during that time.[107]In February 1890, the Singer Manufacturing Company acquired the lot at 151–153 Broadway.[108] The next month, they bought the lots at 149 Broadway and 83 Liberty Street, at the northwest corner of the two streets.[108][109] The three lots had cost the company over $950,000 (equivalent to $25,645,000 in 2020), and at the time were occupied by four- to six-story buildings.[108] The three lots were separate prior to the Singer Company's acquisition but, under their ownership, were combined.[110]The Singer Manufacturing Company hired Ernest Flagg for the design of their new headquarters. Flagg filed plans for the new Singer Building at 149 Broadway in early 1897. They called for a 10-story stone-and-brick building with banking rooms on the lowest two stories, rental office space on six of the center stories, and the Singer Company's offices on the upper stories.[32][111] Construction began that year. While workers were excavating the site in June 1897, a water main burst and flooded the lot.[112] Despite this, the new Singer Building was completed in early 1898.[4][113]In December 1897, before the new Singer headquarters was completed, Bourne bought three five-story structures for the company at 85–89 Liberty Street, on a plot measuring 74.8 by 99.8 feet (22.8 by 30.4 m).[111][114][115] Flagg was retained to design the 14-story Bourne Building on the site, and when he submitted building plans in 1898, the annex was estimated to cost $450,000.[33][116] Bourne did not take title to the Bourne Building's site until September 1899,[117] and the Bourne Building was completed the same year.[4] By 1900, the Singer and Bourne buildings were both fully occupied.[111] The tenants included the law office of Augustus Van Wyck,[118] and the Trust Company of America.[119] Boiler manufacturers Babcock & Wilcox were long-term tenants, occupying the Singer Building for more than forty years from the beginning of the 20th century.[120]Further acquisitions followed in the first decade of the 20th century. In 1900, Bourne bought an iron-front building at 155 and 157 Broadway, with a frontage of about 39.8 feet (12.1 m) on Broadway.[111][114] The purchase of 163 Broadway, a house with a frontage of only 12.5 feet (3.8 m), followed in 1902,[121] and in 1903 by the purchase of the five-story 93 Liberty Street, which added a frontage of 27 feet (8.2 m).[122] By 1905, the Singer Company controlled most of the block along both Broadway and Liberty Street; the original Singer Building was an L-shaped structure extending west and then north from the northwestern corner of Broadway and Liberty Street.[123]Concurrently with the land acquisitions, Flagg was retained to design a second addition to the Singer Building in 1902. By early the next year, he was planning a building that would be the tallest in the world, with over 35 stories.[4] However, the Singer Manufacturing Company did not reveal specific details until February 1906, when it announced that it would build a 594-foot (181 m) tower, the world's tallest.[91][124] Revised plans were filed in July 1906, which provided for a more wind-resistant structure.[125] The company intended to occupy the space above the 31st floor and planned to rent out the bottom section of the tower to tenants to subsidize their use of the upper floors.[4] The Singer Company projected that it would earn $250,000 in rent per year, given a baseline rental cost of $3 per square foot ($32/m2).[126] Engineers were hired to create the construction plans as soon as the architect's plans and specifications were published.[127]Before the foundations were built, the builders drilled several test boreholes to determine the composition of the underlying soil.[22][64] Contracts for digging the foundation were awarded in August 1906 before the plans were approved.[128] The plans for the Singer Tower were approved on September 12, 1906,[129] and excavation began later that month,[62][63][129] with work officially beginning on September 19.[15][129] A timber platform, measuring 30 feet (9.1 m) wide and descending from Broadway to the excavation site, was constructed so that workers could receive materials and extract soil more efficiently.[63] The first steel shipments for the anchorages arrived in October 1906.[127] Foundation work was completed on February 18, 1907.[129]The superstructure was constructed afterward. A temporary elevator was installed while the tower's superstructure was being erected.[130] During the construction process, city building inspectors alleged the builders had violated city law by installing concrete flooring instead of hollow-tile floors. As a result, the builders were ordered to replace some non-compliant arches.[131] By August 1907, the steel frame had reached 36 stories, surpassing the Washington Monument's height.[132] That month, Prince Wilhelm of Sweden visited the 29th floor to see the construction process.[133] On October 4, 1907, the building topped out with the hoisting of the flagpole.[134][135] After the building topped out, the interiors were furnished and plastered.[73] Despite high winds, there were no serious accidents during construction.[13] There was a small fire on the 40th floor in February 1908, which the Los Angeles Times described at the time as "the highest fire in any building in the world".[136]In late 1905, Flagg was hired to design a westward annex to the Bourne Building and a northward annex to the original Singer Building. The Bourne and Singer buildings were to be united internally, and the old Singer Building was to be expanded to 14 stories.[19] The top story of the Bourne Building would also be expanded so that it would cover the same area as the Bourne Building's lower floors.[137] Plans for the Bourne and Singer extensions were filed in late 1906 and early 1907, respectively.[129]During the construction of the Singer Tower, the original Singer Building was shored up and additional foundations were built.[36][65][138] The top three stories of the old Singer Building, including the mansard roof, were temporarily taken apart in June 1907, so that four more stories could be inserted above the existing seventh story. As such, the old eighth story of the old Singer Building became the new 12th story. This added 15,600 square feet (1,450 m2) of usable space without disturbing tenants on the lower floors.[36][139] Several columns were erected at the old building's front and rear elevations, extending from the basement to the 11th floor to support the raised roof. Holes were created in the existing floors of the Singer Building so that they could be supported by steel columns instead of by the bearing walls.[48] The old Singer Building was extended north by 74 feet (23 m), the three extra bays on Broadway having the same style as the original two.[2]In the Bourne Building, the three existing elevators were removed and replaced with four elevators, necessitating the complete replacement of the framing around the old elevator shafts.[48] A small window replaced the main entrance to the original Singer Building.[2]On May 1, 1908, the tower was opened to the public.[62][129] The construction workers held a dinner that week to celebrate the completion of work.[140] A month later, on June 23, the observation balcony opened.[90] The Singer Building quickly became a symbol of Manhattan with its floodlit tower.[13] Surpassing Philadelphia City Hall in height, the Singer Building remained the tallest in the world for a year after its tower's completion.[141] The record was surpassed by the 700-foot (210 m) Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower,[7] at 24th Street and Madison Avenue.[142][c]In the building's first few months, the elevators were involved in at least two deaths; a painter was decapitated on May 4, 1908,[143] while a plumber's assistant was crushed between an elevator cab and a shaft on July 24, 1908.[144] In a publicity stunt in 1911, the aviator Harry Atwood flew around the Singer Building.[145] The expanded building's tenants included the Chatham and Phenix National Bank, whose main office moved to the Singer Building in 1916.[146] The Safe Deposit Company of New York originally used the vaults.[88][147] The power source for the building's steam plant was converted from coal to oil in 1921, making the Singer Building the city's first office building to use oil as a fuel.[148]In 1921, the Singer Company placed the building up for sale at an asking price of $10 million.[149] Four years later, the company made an agreement with a buyer representing the Utilities Power and Light Corporation, a holding company for several states' power companies. The transaction involved a cash deal of $8.5 million.[150][151] According to property records, the sale was never finalized.[15] Also in 1925, a subbasement vault was dug for the Chatham and Phenix National Bank after the bank's merger with the Metropolitan Trust Company, and three of the lower floors were renovated for the bank's use.[152]Over the Singer Building's existence, its lighting system was changed at least five times.[2] The copper ornamentation on the tower's dome was restored in 1939.[81] The flagpole and roof cresting were removed entirely in early 1947.[2] The building experienced an electrical fire in 1949 that forced the evacuation of the entire building, although only one person was injured.[153][154] The revolving doors at the base had been removed by 1958, being replaced with standard doors. A year later, new elevators and elevator doors were installed to comply with building codes. Toward the end of its existence, the Singer Building's two large ground-level storefronts were subdivided into smaller ones.[2] Taller buildings continued to be constructed in New York City; by its 50th anniversary in 1958, the Singer Building was only the 16th tallest in the city.[155]Singer announced it would sell the building in 1961, and the company moved to 30 Rockefeller Plaza.[156][157] According to property records, Iacovone Rose bought the Singer Building and immediately sold it to Financial Place Inc.[15] Real estate developer William Zeckendorf acquired the building and unsuccessfully attempted to convince the New York Stock Exchange to move there. In 1964, United States Steel bought the Singer and City Investing buildings.[158] U.S. Steel planned to demolish the entire block to erect a new 54-story headquarters on the same site.[159]The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission was created in 1965,[160] in the wake of several notable buildings in the city having either been demolished or threatened with demolition.[161] Although the Singer Building was considered to be one of the most iconic buildings in New York City, it did not receive landmark designation, which would have prevented it from being torn down. In August 1967, the commission's executive director Alan Burnham said that if the building were to have been made a landmark, the city would have to either find a buyer for it or acquire it.[162] Sam Roberts later wrote in The New York Times that the Singer Building had been one of the city's notable structures that "weren't considered worth preserving".[163] Demolition had commenced by September 1967.[164] A New York Times writer observed in March 1968 that the lobby looked like "a bomb had hit it".[13] The last piece of scrap had been carted away in early 1969, and the New York Daily News observed, "The Singer fell victim to a malady called progress."[165]The U.S. Steel Building (later known as One Liberty Plaza) was built on the site and completed in 1973.[85] One Liberty Plaza contained 37,000 square feet (3,400 m2) per floor, compared with the 4,200 square feet (390 m2) per floor in the Singer Building's tower.[7] One Liberty Plaza had at least twice the two former buildings' combined interior area.[166] At the time of the Singer Building's demolition, it was the tallest building ever to be destroyed.[18][167][168] The record was surpassed during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which caused the collapse of the nearby World Trade Center.[5] Afterward, the Singer Building remained the tallest building to be destroyed by its owners,[169] until 2019, when workers started demolishing the 707-foot (215 m) 270 Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan.[170] In the 21st century, the Singer Building became the subject of an unfounded conspiracy theory, which claimed that the skyscraper was evidence of a long-lost civilization.[171][172]Flagg, a noted critic of existing skyscrapers, justified taking on the project as a way of generating support for skyscraper reform, by convincing the public that such tall skyscrapers were detrimental because they blocked light from reaching the surrounding streets.[173] As late as 1904, one architectural magazine wrote that "ten stories were his limit".[174] According to Flagg, buildings over 10 or 15 stories needed to have a setback tower occupying no more than a quarter of the lot.[1][110] He had once written, "Our rooms and offices are becoming so dark that we must use artificial light all day long."[3] The Singer Building's design expressed Flagg's opinions on city planning and skyscraper design.[110] Landau and Condit wrote in 1996 that the building's design partly influenced the city's 1916 Zoning Resolution, which required skyscrapers in New York City to have setbacks as they rose. For over four decades, the ordinance prevented the city's new skyscrapers from overwhelming the streets with their sheer bulk.[d] These setbacks were not required if the building occupied 25 percent or less of its lot area.[85]New York Times architectural critic Christopher Gray said in 2005 that the Singer Building's tower resembled "a bulbous mansard and giant lantern".[7] Architectural writer Jason Barr stated in 2016 that the Singer Building was a "transitional building" in skyscraper development.[5] Landau and Condit described the building as "an aesthetic triumph that enriched the city by demonstrating the sculptural possibilities of the steel-framed skyscraper".[85] When the building was being demolished, Ada Louise Huxtable said, "The master never produced a more impressive ruin than the Singer Building under demolition."[177] Not all critics appraised the Singer Building positively; the New York Globe in the 1900s had called the Singer Building an "architectural giraffe" and said such a tall building would hinder the ability of fire services to rescue people on the upper floors.[13]
